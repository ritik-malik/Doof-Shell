# Doof-Shell
## A custom bash/UNIX shell in C
### <<   Hii, Welcome To The Doof_Shell   >>
----------------------------------------

This custom shell takes 5 internal commands:
1) echo (here, " " can be used as they are in original) (-n can be used)
2) cd 
3) history
4) pwd
5) exit

* This shell also takes all the external commands listed in /bin
* It can take multiple arguments like : ls -l -a -ih
			      	or: cat -n f1 f2 f3 f4
* It can also handle cases like :$    ls     -a     -l
	which have multiple spaces.
* Typing only cd will also work
* We can also run shell inside a shell, bash & other are also supported
  & can also compile this shell inside & run again.
* Colour scheme makes it attractive :P
* Limitations : Empty input doesn't work (but with space & tab it works)
		No. of quotes dont matter in echo, it removes all
